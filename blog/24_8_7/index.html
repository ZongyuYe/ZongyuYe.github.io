  <p>Fair Financial Transactions on Cloud Driven by Graph Neural Networks</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Currently, migrating financial transactions to public cloud platforms is becoming increasingly popular in the industry. This is because cloud services offer flexibility, stability, and cost savings compared to traditional local configurations.</p>
<p>However, moving to the public cloud also presents several challenges. Firstly, each market participant (MP) needs to receive financial transaction information simultaneously to ensure they all have the same reaction time. The competition among MPs should be based on their reaction time to the transaction information, which is the time from when an MP receives the transaction information to when they respond.</p>
<p>Public clouds make it difficult to achieve these goals due to their inherent characteristics. The latency within public clouds is complex, and network congestion can make synchronizing information challenging. Additionally, accurate clock synchronization is essential for measuring reaction time precisely, but this is difficult to achieve in practice. As a result, cloud-based financial transactions can be unfair, favoring users with better equipment and closer proximity to the cloud.</p>
<p>The current solution employs high-precision clocks and an improved multicast scheme to address part of the problem. However, there are still many areas that can be improved.</p>
<ol>
<li>Current schemes do not fully address both the synchronization of transactions to participants and the fairness of transaction contention, meaning the system as a whole remains inadequately considered.</li>
<li>Most methods still operate on a best-effort basis, resulting in unfairness and highlighting opportunities for optimization.</li>
<li>No existing approach accounts for extreme network latency, which can cause some competitors, who could have otherwise won the deal, to lose opportunities due to network issues. (Avoiding extreme network latency is crucial.)</li>
<li>Efficiently and accurately calculating reaction time to determine the winner of a transaction remains a challenge in this field. Additionally, considering that information provided by market participants can be deceptive, addressing this issue is also important.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="my-methods">My Methods</h1>
<p>First, we need to address the problem of ensuring that transactions arrive synchronously to each participant.</p>
<p>To tackle this, I propose introducing a graph neural network model that learns the graph structure over multiple points in time, with latency as the primary input. This model will predict when each transaction will arrive at different participants when the transaction is issued. A high-precision neural network model will be used to synchronize the transaction announcement time.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/figures/24_8_7/fig1.png" alt="image-20240807180643880"></p>
<p>Figure 1: We assume that P represents a participant, M an intermediate switching node, and C the cloud from which the transaction is issued. The proposed GNN can predict the link delay at the next time node based on the previous time graph.</p>
<hr>
<p>Based on Figure 1, we use a buffer to control the sending time point of the transaction, ensuring that each transaction reaches the various participants as synchronously as possible. This approach translates the best effort into the optimal performance that the GNN can achieve.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/figures/24_8_7/fig2.png" alt="image-20240807181307770"></p>
<p>Figure 2: For each market participant, the transaction information should be submitted synchronously as far as possible. Because the normal delay of the network is not high, the waiting time can be set and each transaction can be sent at a different time, so that all participants are fair.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the GNN I propose, the model should be efficient to meet the high-frequency characteristics of financial transactions.</p>
<p>The first component is local graph inference. Local graph inference in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) focuses on performing computations on a subset of the graph rather than the entire graph. This approach is particularly useful for handling large-scale graphs, as it reduces computational complexity and improves efficiency. Inference is performed only on the nodes of interest and their neighborhoods, without the need to process the entire graph.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/figures/24_8_7/fig3.png" alt="image-20240807195440584"></p>
<p>Figure 3: When the originator of a transaction only exists in a local graph, when performing inference, we sample the graph instead of processing all of it to speed up execution.</p>
<hr>
<p>The second component is the introduction of neural networks with periodic function activation. As mentioned in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09661v1.pdf">&ldquo;Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions&rdquo;</a>, under certain circumstances, using periodic functions for feature learning can retain more details and perceive periodic signals, which is relevant to this problem.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to potential unexpected network conditions, we aim to introduce a multi-operator, multi-path scheme. Different operators at different times experience varying network conditions. In our GNN, incorporating multiple path selection (i.e., considering multiple potential edges) can effectively reduce the likelihood of users missing transactions due to excessive congestion, thereby improving the system&rsquo;s throughput.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/figures/24_8_7/fig4.png" alt="image-20240807201147956"></p>
<p>Figure 4: For user P, intermediate switching node M, and cloud node C, there are path choices provided by multiple operators to ensure as fair as possible in the unstable cloud environment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we need to demonstrate that we can eliminate clock asynchrony and user clock spoofing as much as possible.</p>
<p>For the timestamp of the transaction arriving at the user, we uniformly use the cloud&rsquo;s timestamp plus the predicted link duration. Assume that the initial cloud timestamp is G and the predicted transmission time is Ts; the arrival timestamp is G+Ts. In this case, the error only stems from the difference between the predicted time and the actual network transmission time. This assumes that our system can be synchronized with releases.</p>
<p>For the timestamp when a market participant initiates a transaction, we define it as the timestamp C when the transaction request reaches the cloud minus the predicted link delay Tr. This approach converts asynchronous clock issues and potential user spoofing errors into GNN accuracy.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation-method">Evaluation method</h1>
<p>The metrics we focus on include fairness, latency, throughput, and the number of host users. Fairness encompasses several aspects: achieved fairness (whether users receive transactions synchronously), fairness of contention (whether they are strictly ordered by reaction time), and whether transactions are missed due to excessive network latency. Latency evaluates the speed of the system and whether forwarding can be completed at high speed. Throughput measures the maximum concurrent transaction capacity. The number of host users indicates the maximum number of users that the system can support.</p>
